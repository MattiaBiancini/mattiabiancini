        Hi, I'm {person.firstName}, a passionate design engineer with a knack for creating
        intuitive user experiences. I thrive at the intersection of design and technology, where I
        can bring ideas to life through innovative design solutions. My journey has taken me from
        studying software engineering to leading design projects that enhance user engagement and
        streamline workflows. When I'm not designing, you can find me exploring new technologies or
        working on personal projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in design.
